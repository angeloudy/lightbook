## Development mode

1. Make sure you have python and pip installed
2. `# pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `# npm install`
4. `# npm start`
5. `# python development.py`

Now you can open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and browse the project.
This will use sample test json data rather than a real connection to LDAP.

## Production mode

1. Make sure you have python and pip installed
2. `# pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `# npm install`
4. `# npm run build`
5. `# python production.py`
